üëê Theremotion is a virtual instrument inspired by the Theremin.

Just like a Theremin, the position of your hand in the air controls the pitch
and volume of the sound. However, you can also control much more dimensions of
the sound with specific motions.

With specific hand positions, you can control a low pass filter, a supersaw
sound, a guitar sound and more. You can even make the instrument "stick" to a
scale, making it much easier to control than a Theremin.

## Instructions

Head over to the [Theremotion website](https://plule.github.io/theremotion/) for
instructions on usage and installation.

## Tools

[![Leap Motion Controller](site/doc/ultraleap.png)](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/) [![Faust](site/doc/faust.png)]((https://faust.grame.fr/)) [![Rust](site/doc/rust.png)](https://www.rust-lang.org)

The hand tracking is provided by Ultraleap's [Leap Motion Controller](https://www.ultraleap.com/product/leap-motion-controller/).

The sound generation is created with Grame's [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/).

The program is built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Development

In order to build Theremotion, you need to install
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Ultraleap's tracking
software](https://developer.leapmotion.com/tracking-software-download). If you
wish to modify the sound generation, you also need to install
[Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/).

Build with `cargo build`. When modifying the DSP, set the environment variable
`THEREMOTION_REGEN_DSP` to any value in order to regenerate the DSP code when
running `cargo build`.

If using the Orion version of Ultraleap, build with `cargo build
--no-default-features`.

If the tracking software is installed at a custom path, set the environment
variable `LEAPSDK_LIB_PATH` to the absolute path of the
`Ultraleap/LeapSDK/lib/x64` before running the build.

### Linux

Building on Linux requires to install some development libraries including:

- `libasound2-dev`

## License

With the exception of any third-parties (such as the Rust, Faust and Ultraleap
logos, the Ultraleap redistributables, the Noto Emoji font), Theremotion is
